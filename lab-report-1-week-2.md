<!-- 
You will write a tutorial for incoming 15L students (and your future self!) about how to  Your post should include the steps you took, along with screenshots of what each step looked like. You’re free to use the screenshots you took for lab 1, or new ones. Complete any steps you didn’t complete in your group on your own.

Overall, make sure you have at least 6 screenshots, one for each of the steps below (though more is useful, remember that this will help out your future self). For each step include 2-3 sentences or bullet points describing what you did.

Installing VScode
Remotely Connecting
Trying Some Commands
Moving Files with scp
Setting an SSH Key
Optimizing Remote Running

You should complete the writing on your own. Feel free to ask anyone (staff or other students are fine!) for help if you’re struggling to get remote access set up, understand commands, get your writing to show up on Github Pages, etc. But do not get help from anyone on authoring the report itself – the writing and screenshots must be your own.

You will upload your submission by giving a link to your web page in the Lab 1 Report – Week 2 assignment on Gradescope. -->
