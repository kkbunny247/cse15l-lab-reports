# **LAB 5 REPORT**


We are going to be comparing the results of two `MarkdownParse.java` implementations when they run the tests from the `test-files` folder.

#### **STUDENT REPOSITORY:** [https://github.com/m1ma0314/markdown-parse](https://github.com/m1ma0314/markdown-parse)

<br/>

We found the differences between the test results by using the program `diff`, which compares two files line by line and produces an output that shows exactly where the outputs vary.

This is what we entered on the terminal or Command Prompt if `results.txt` is the output of `test-files`:
```
diff some-markdown-parse/results.txt other-markdown-parse/results.txt > resultsDiffs.txt
```
<br/>

### **Test File #490**
```
[link](<foo
bar>)
```
#### **student results:**

#### **class results:**

#### **EXPECTED OUTPUT**

Using CommonMark, we see that the **class implementation** is correct because it produces `[]`, as `<foo
bar>` should not be recognized as a link. 

The ***bug*** in the student implementation is that the code in `MarkdownParse.java` allows links to span over over line or after a line break. 

#### **THE FIX** 

<br/>

### **Test File #510**
```
[link] (/uri)
```

#### **student results:**

#### **class results:**

#### **EXPECTED OUTPUT** 
![image](Screenshot2022-03-10160512.png)

Using CommonMark, we see that the **student implementation** is correct because it produces `[]`, as `/uri` should not be recognized as a link. 

The ***bug*** in the class implementation is that the code in `MarkdownParse.java` still recognizes the link even when there is a space between the closed bracket and open parenthesis.

#### **THE FIX**
