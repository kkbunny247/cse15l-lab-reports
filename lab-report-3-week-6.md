# **LAB 3 REPORT**


So far, everytime we have remotely connected to the UCSD server, we have been having to enter `ssh cs15lwi22zzz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`. Hopefully, you have been utilizing | `Ctrl C`  | `Ctrl V` | to copy-paste the line into your command prompt (unless you really remembered the entire `ssh cs15lwi22zzz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` ... ). 

No worries! We can make this process of logging into our `ieng6` account much faster and simpler. The following is a tutorial on streamlining our `ssh` configuration.

> FOR WINDOWS USERS ONLY:
- This should have been done already because it was needed to get to the UCSD server in the first place, but if you have not done so yet, we have to install a program called OpenSSH, which allows us to connect remotely.
- Navigate to "Optional Features" in "Settings." Search and install OpenSSH Client and OpenSSH Server. When you are done, proceed with the next steps!
